Arks-System Tool (v4)
=====================

Another launcher for PSO2. Can update, translate partially and launch the game.  
It also provides fixes like applying the right rights to the binaries and removing GameGuard's folder to redownload it.

The repository contains the updater for the tool but not the backend scripts, those scripts are on [another repository](https://github.com/Arks-System/Arks-SystemTool_Repository) and are really just put together as a proof of concept.  
That's not very clean but it works until something catches fire.
